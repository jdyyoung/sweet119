WARNING: unexpected liborc library version 0.4.25 is being picked up by /usr/local/bin/orcc, which is version 0.4.26. This might be because orc was installed from source and is also installed via packages, and liborc from the wrong prefix is used. Check your system setup.

yasm/nasm not found or too old. Use --disable-yasm for a crippled build.

If you think configure made a mistake, make sure you are using the latest
version from Git.  If the latest version fails, report the problem to the
ffmpeg-user@ffmpeg.org mailing list or IRC #ffmpeg on irc.freenode.net.
Include the log file "config.log" produced by configure as this will help
solve the problem.
